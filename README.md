- [**Frontend**](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/User-Mangment-System_Frontend)
- Technologies used: `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `Spring Security`, `PostgreSQL`, `Angular`
### Bookstore Web Application
- [**Backend**](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/BookstoreBackend)
   - The backend consists of three microservices: app.js (handles core application logic), app_auth.js (manages authentication), and app_rest.js (exposes REST APIs).
- [**Frontend**](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/bookstore_vue_frontend)
- Technologies used: `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `MariaDB`, `Vue.js`

##
### `Concurrent and Distributed Systems`
***
### [RafBook](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/RafBook)
- Distributed system for managing text files and images.
- Functionalities: adding files, retrieving files, deleting files.
- Optimized System Topology: The organization of the system enables faster searching and retrieval of files (Distributed Hash Table).
- Fault Tolerance: The system is resistant to failures and provides data recovery options.
- Developed solely in `Java`
### [Concurrent Matrix Solver](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/ConcurrentMatrixSolver)
- The Matrix Solver system is designed to support the multiplication of pre-defined matrices of arbitrary sizes.
- This operation is performed concurrently, with the ability to add new matrices as well as view the results of individual matrices and display all matrices.
- Developed solely in `Java`
##
### `Kafka`
***
### [Hacker News Kafka](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/HackerNewsKafka)
- This project is a `Java` application that integrates Kafka producers and consumers to collect data into csv files from the Hacker News API.
##
### `Core Java`
***
### [Mini Web Framework](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/Mini-Web-Framework)
- This project implements a mini web framework inspired by JAX-RS and Spring.
- The framework is designed around controllers that handle incoming requests and generate JSON responses.
- It supports dependency injection at the controller level.
### [Simple Interpreter](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/SimpleInterpeter)
- This `Java` project implements an interpreter for a simple programming language that supports variable assignment, scoped operations, and variable printing.
### [Java Class Dependency Validator](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/ClasspathValidator)
- Java library that provides a way to validate whether a Java class can be run with a classpath made out of a list of passed jars.
### [SQL to MongoQL Translator](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/SQL_To_MongoQL_Translator)
- Developed a tool for user interaction with MongoDB using SQL queries.
- The tool allows users to write SQL queries which will be translated to MongoQL and executed in the MongoDB database.
- GUI is based on `Java Swing`, it supports user interaction with the database similar to the Live SQL tool.
### [SQL Query Builder](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/SQLQueryBuilder)
- Java-based library that helps generate SQL queries using a custom, user-friendly query syntax.
- It comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using `Java Swing`, which allows users to write queries in a simple manner.
- The resulting tables are displayed in the GUI.
### [GeRuMap](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/GeRuMap)
- GeRuMap is software that provides an environment and tools for creating and editing mind maps
- Built with `Java Swing`.

##
### `Machine learning and Genetic algorithms`
***
### [Continuous Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/ContinousGeneticAlgorithm)
- Fitting a neural network in the `g.c` file written in `C++` using a continuous genetic algorithm implemented in `Python`.
### [Neural Network Titanic](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/NeuralNetworkTitanic)
- Built a neural network from scratch (manually implemented without Keras) to classify Titanic passengers based on whether they survived or not. 
### [Decision Tree Titanic](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/DecisionTreeTitanic)
- Built a decision tree model to classify passengers from the Titanic dataset based on whether they survived or not. 
### [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/K-NearestNeighbors)
- Applied the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify passengers based on the dataset `spaceship-titanic.csv`.
### [Polinomial Regression](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/PolynomialRegression)
- Training polynomial regression models of varying degrees and exploring the effects of L2 regularization.
##
### `C and Operating Systems`
***
### [Multithreading in C](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/MultithreadingInC)
- This project implements a C program for Linux that allows searching through a directory structure and finding prime numbers in the files within that structure.
### [Operating Systems Project 1](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/OperatingSystemsProject1)
- This project adds functionality to change the text and background colors in the XV6 operating system.
- Supports a color selection table that allows users to navigate and select items.
### [Operating Systems Project 2](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/OperatingSystemsProject2)
- This project focuses on creating, reading, writing, editing, and deleting large files using double indirect pointers in the inode structure for the XV6 operating system.
- Along with implementing encryption for specific files on disk.
