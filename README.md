# üõ†Ô∏è Projects

### `Web Development & Microservices Projects`
***
### Backend for a banking application [(repo)](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/Banka-2-Backend)
- The backend for this banking application is built using Java and Spring Boot, following a microservices architecture.
- Technologies used: `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `PostgreSQL`,`RabbitMQ`, `Redis` ,`Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `JUnit`, `Cucumber` 
### Robot Vacuum Management System
- Web application that simulates the management of vacuum cleaner robots.
- [**Vacuum Service**](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/Vacuum-Service)
   - REST API Service that allows users to add, control, and schedule operations for vacuum cleaners, while managing user permissions for specific actions.   
- [**User Managment Service**](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/User-Managment-System)
- [**Frontend**](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/Vacuum-Service-Frontend)
- Technologies used: `Java`, `Spring Boot`, `PostgreSQL`,`RabbitMQ`, `Angular`
### Bookstore Web Application
- [**Backend**](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/BookstoreBackend)
   - The backend consists of three microservices: app.js (handles core application logic), app_auth.js (manages authentication), and app_rest.js (exposes REST APIs).
- [**Frontend**](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/bookstore_vue_frontend)
- Technologies used: `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `Express.js`, `MariaDB`, `Vue.js`
##
### `Core Java`
***
### [Java Class Dependency Validator](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/ClasspathValidator)
- Java library that provides a way to validate whether a Java class can be run with a classpath made out of a list of passed jars.

##
### `Machine learning and Genetic algorithms`
***
### [Continuous Genetic Algorithm](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/ContinousGeneticAlgorithm)
- Fitting a neural network in the `g.c` file written in `C++` using a continuous genetic algorithm implemented in `Python`.
### [Neural Network Titanic](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/NeuralNetworkTitanic)
- Built a neural network from scratch (manually implemented without Keras) to classify Titanic passengers based on whether they survived or not. 
### [Decision Tree Titanic](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/DecisionTreeTitanic)
- Built a decision tree model to classify passengers from the Titanic dataset based on whether they survived or not. 
### [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/K-NearestNeighbors)
- Applied the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to classify passengers based on the dataset `spaceship-titanic.csv`.
### [Polinomial Regression](https://github.com/MihajloCumic/PolynomialRegression)
- Training polynomial regression models of varying degrees and exploring the effects of L2 regularization.
